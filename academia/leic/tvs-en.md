goals: |
  A student completing this course unit should be able to:
  1. Identify the key objectives of an operating system and the key components of its internal architecture
     Understand the differences between user and kernel mode and the system call concept and implementation.
  2. Understand relevant aspects of the implementation and use of the major concepts of operating systems, 
     namely those related to memory management (physical and virtual), I/O and file systems, 
     and the management of processes and threads.
  3. Develop applications that take advantage of the API of operating systems such as Linux.
  4. Understand and use different forms of virtualization, namely system virtualization supported 
     by virtual machine monitors (hypervisors) and at the level of the operating system (containers).

    <li>
      Inter-process communication mechanisms.
    </li>
    <li>
      Design of file systems and input / output models.
    </li>
    <li>
      Support for the building of virtual machines. Virtual machine monitors.
    </li>

    </li>
  <ol>
outcomes: |
    The knowledge on the theoretical aspects of operating systems is obtained through interactive lectures and exercises. 
    The lectures are complemented with practical sessions in which students have to solve problems using the development tools 
    that will be used in the resolution of practical work.
    The skills listed in sections 2, 3 e 4 of the learning objectives are developed in the work group.
    Lectures are also dedicating to monitoring practical group work, complementing the evaluation of 
    overall learning outcomes on the final discussion
