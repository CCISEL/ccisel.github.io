goals: |
  Students who successfully complete this course unit should be able to:
  1. Demonstrate know-how on software development principles;
  2. Identify software properties and demonstrate know how on the techniques used to influence them;
  3. Analyze and justify the application of design patterns in selected contexts;

  <ol type="I">
    <li>
      Basic principles of type driven development: encapsulation and contract specification and its invariants
    </li>
    <li>
      Basic principles of test-driven development: explicit specification of dependencies and their resolution through dependency injection.
    </li>

    </li>
    <li>
      Type composition: aggregation, inheritance and polymorphism.
    </li>
    <li>
      General principles of software development: DRY, Law of Demeter and SOLID.

outcomes: |
    This curricular unit introduces the fundamental concepts and the vocabulary of the paradigms and principles used in software development.

    Goals 1, 2 and 3 are achieved through items I to VII of the syllabus.
    The development of programs during practical sessions makes it possible to achieve goals 4 and 5 of learning outcomes.
