outcomes: |
  In this curricular unit,
  students understand the execution model of programs written in high-level languages
  in the real computational system (points II, III, V and VI of the programmatic contents)
  and acquire the practice of developing modular applications in C language (points I and IV).
  Such capabilities are critical to progression in the areas of operating systems and embedded systems.
  In the practical component on points IV and VI, students develop applications,
  in C language, using standard open-source libraries.
  Finally, the introduction to RAM access caches (point III)
  supports further studies in the area of concurrent programming.
