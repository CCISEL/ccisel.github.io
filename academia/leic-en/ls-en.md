goals: |
  1. Develop software systems, using relational database management systems and object oriented programming techniques.
  2. Integrate software development teams in medium-sized projects.
  3. Correctly use software development tools, such as version control systems, build automation tools and testing frameworks.
syllabus: |
  1. Version control systems and their associated usage practices (e.g. Git).
  2. Development environment organization and build automation processes (e.g. Gradle).
  3. Automatic software tests (unitary, functional and integration) and associated frameworks (e.g. JUnit).
  4. Development supporting applications, namely wikis and issue trackers (e.g. GitHub).
outcomes: |
  The first goal of this curricular unit is the consolidation of concepts and practices provided in previous units, namely Object Oriented Programming, Algorithms and Data Structures, and Information Systems I. So, this first learning outcome is ensured by the usage and refinement of the theoretical and practical subjects provided in this previous units.
  The second goal is to provide the students with the ability to work in development teams (goal 2.) and correctly use the concepts and practices associated with professional software development (goal 3.). The syllabus contents 2, 3 and 4, as well as their usage in an applied context, are the main contributors for this goal.
