goals: |
  Students who successfully complete this course will be able to:
  1. Know, understand and use fundamental algorithms and data structures;
  2. Analyze the correctness and performance of simple algorithms;
  3. Choose, in a justified way, data structures best suited to each problem and apply them to its resolution;
  4. Data structures design and respective algorithms to its manipulation.

outcomes: |
    The coherence between program content and objectives of the course is as follows:
    - IV and III provide the key to achieve the objective 3;
    - VI covers the techniques of design and analysis identified in objectives 2 and 4;
    - Despite all the contents contribute to the objective 1, the most relevant are I, II, III, IV and V.
