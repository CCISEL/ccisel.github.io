At the 25th International Conference on Web Information Systems Engineering
(WISE) in Qatar, Miguel Gamboa presented a groundbreaking approach to
Progressive Server-Side Rendering (PSSR). This paper introduces an innovative
method to enhance user experiences by optimizing the first contentful paint and
enabling incremental rendering as data becomes available. Addressing the
complexities of constructing web templates for asynchronous data models, the
proposal leverages the <code>async/await</code> pattern to ensure seamless, non-blocking
progress while maintaining well-formed HTML output. This research marks a
significant step forward in simplifying server-side rendering workflows for
modern web applications.
