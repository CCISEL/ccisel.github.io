CCISEL site has been updated to include a navigation structure that leads to the LEIC curriculum pages, both in English and Portuguese.

We are aiming to provide easy and fast navigation capabilities over Computer Science and Engineer curriculum diagram that let users effectively access up-to-date information about the courses in programming and computer systems courses that are led by CCISEL engineers.

Try it yourself and check each course, navigating the new LEIC layout.
