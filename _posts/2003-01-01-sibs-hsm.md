CCISEL is developing a multi-platform software library for IF (Integer Factorization) based cryptographic schemes, following the X9.31 and X9.30 ANSI specifications.
It includes key pair generation, signature creation, and signature validation functionalities.

This library runs both on x86-based systems and on specialized HSMs (High Security Module) systems, based on the MCS-51 Intel architecture and on cryptographic coprocessors.

This project is done in collaboration with [SIBS](https://www.sibs.com/en/company/), a large-scale payments company operating in Europe and Africa, and aims to be used for [EMV](https://www.emvco.com/)-based card issuance and transactions.
