The book [Designing Evolvable Web APIs with ASP.NET](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-evolvable-web/9781449337919/), co-authored by Pedro Félix, was published by O'Reilly Media.

From the foreword by Henrick Frystyk Nielsen, co-author of RFC 2616.

> What makes this book stand out, however, is that it doesn’t just provide a “point in time” set of guidelines for how to build a web API. It takes you on a journey through how to design a web API that can evolve with changing demands and constraints. This idea of addressing evolvability goes to the very heart of how the Web works.
