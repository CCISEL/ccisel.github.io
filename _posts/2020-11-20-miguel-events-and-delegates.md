Almost 20 years after, Dotnet is still on the race and many developers are still
misunderstanding the weird conception between Events and Delegates. 

Today, we have already abandoned Events and `MulticasteDelegate` from VM course
curricular plan, just because we do not need them.
Functional composition solves the same issues with less effort and complexity. 

Nevertheless, Events are still there and ready to be used on Dotnet and many
developers do not understand them entirely. 
Not even their relationship with delegates.  

Today CCISEL engineer Miguel Gamboa gave another clarification about this topic
answering to the following question on Stackoverflow:
[_Can I say that the relation between events and delegates adopts composite pattern?_](https://stackoverflow.com/q/64906053/1140754)
