On October 3rd, 2024, the Kotlin Lisbon Meetup held its 9th edition, marking the first
gathering after the summer break. The event took place at the Mercedes-Benz.io
offices in Lisbon. The meetup featured a packed agenda and brought together
Kotlin enthusiasts for an engaging evening. 

Paulo Pereira delivered a presentation titled
[Kotlin Meetup Lisbon - Mutability: Necessity or Habit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-sJhepOzSCc).
Kotlin, a language designed to emphasize immutability alongside mutability,
requires programmers to decide at the point of declaration: variable or value?
This approach contrasts with languages like Java, which default to variables and
inherently presume the use of mutations. During the presentation, Paulo examined
the relevance of mutability in modern software development, questioning whether
it is a practical necessity or simply a habit ingrained in the mindset of
imperative programmers. He also discussed the implications of choosing immutable
data by default and the potential gains or losses from challenging the reliance
on mutations.

The session explored these questions from a historical perspective and used
simple, practical examples to highlight the merits and trade-offs of
immutability as a fundamental design principle in software development.
