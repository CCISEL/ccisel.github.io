The Kotlin programming language notoriety and popularity has been increasing
significantly, especially since its adoption by Google as the preferred language
for the Android platform. The Computer Science and Computer Engineering
graduation from ISEL has been a pioneer in adopting Kotlin in some of its
courses, namely in PDM (since 2016) and DAW (since Spring of 2018). Professors
Paulo Pereira, Pedro Pereira and Pedro Félix have been interviewed by Talking
Kotlin’s host, Hadi Hariri, with the intent to talk about the motivations and
experience of using Kotlin for teaching purposes. The interview can be found
