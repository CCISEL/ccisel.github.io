The FaaS-IntOp project lead by CCISEL engineer Filipe Freitas has been awarded
with [IPL IDI&CA](https://www.ipl.pt/id-inovacao/idica).
This project aims to develop a multi-cloud interoperability desktop
tool targeting cloud-agnostic functions development and FaaS deployments. 

The QuickFaaS hides cloud-specific requirements when developing serverless
applications and improve developerâ€™s productivity, flexibility and agility when
dealing with multiple cloud providers.
