In this video ([https://lnkd.in/grwT3WQ](https://lnkd.in/grwT3WQ)) from last year’s NDC Porto conference,
CCISEL engineer Pedro Felix shows how coroutines can be used for asynchronous
and concurrent programming with the Kotlin language.

This presentation starts with the motivation for asynchronous programming and
then covers the Kotlin coroutine model, from suspend functions to coroutine
scopes.
