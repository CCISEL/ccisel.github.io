                Teaching has been one of the focus of CCISEL activity playing a
                primordial role in several restructurings of the Computer
                Science and Computer Engineering curricular programme.

                Most recently in <strong>2019</strong> we have made several proposals in
                programming and computers systems areas including new subjects
                and a new layout that is comprised in a new curricular
                programme starting at <strong>2020/21</strong>.

                Previously in 2006 and according to Bologna requirements we
                had a deep involvement in the definition of the BsC and MsC
                courses resulting in the following curricular programme.
